## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I have taken environmental statistics in undergrad which we used R in. It has honestly been a while since I have used R though, so I am pretty rusty. I have no experience with Git but I seem to git it. 

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I feel confident that I will understand parts of the statistical side of data analytics.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I am apprehensive to the coding aspect. Much like a foreign language, I struggle with it. I really want to get better with R and R studio, so hopefully all this practice will get me there!
